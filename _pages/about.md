Hello world! I'm a researcher with a keen interest in machine learning, computer vision and backend AI engineering. 

I currently work at Microsoft Research Cambridge, on [Project Silica](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica), focusing on high throughput, real-time GPU inference. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Glasgow developing image enhancement machine learning models. Simultaneously I was also building an AI-based metal detection spinout - based on my earlier research associate position with Google.

In my PhD at the University of Glasgow, I explored deep learning and generative AI solutions to super-resolution in the [spatial](https://valentinkapitany.github.io/SiSIFUS/) and [temporal](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.174301) dimensions, using my background in optics to [embed physics](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2214617120) into modelling. My thesis was titled *"AI for time-resolved imaging: from fluorescence lifetime to single pixel time of flight"*. 

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with open-source vision-language models, cycling and reading.
